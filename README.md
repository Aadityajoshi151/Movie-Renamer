## üìù Description:

We all have movies downloaded or taken from someone else that looks something like this: **The.Movie.Name.Goes.Here.2021.720p.WebDL.x265.HEVC--somesuffixhere**

Ask anyone, this naming style does not look good. The only reason we keep it this way is that no one wants to go through the painstaking process of¬†editing all of their movie titles one by one.

This is where **Renameistic** comes into play

A simple utility to clean all your movie titles with just one click. No more unnecessary clutter in the titles. Yayy!

## üîß Features:

- **High Accuracy:** Tested on **4000+** titles with an average accuracy of **94%**.
- **Works Offline:** Unlike similar softwares, renameistic does not use IMDB/MovieDB API to work therefore completely eliminating the need for an internet connection. (Unless checking for updates).
- **No Database:** Works on the concept of string manipulation.
- **Multiple Formats:** Total 12 as of now.
- **Will Receive Regualar Updates:** To improve performance and add new features.
- **Portable:** No Installation Required.
- **Lightweight:** File size is 9 MB.
